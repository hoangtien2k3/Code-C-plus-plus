// ! Differences b/w compile time and run time polymorphism.
/*
    *Compile Time Polymorphism:
       
        + The function to be invoked(gọi, biết tới) is know at the complite time.

        + "Overloading" is a compile time polymorphism where more than one method is having the same name but with the different 
        number of parameters or the type of the parameters.

        + It is achieved by function overloading and operator overloading.

        + It provides fast execution as it is known at the compile time.

        + It is less flexible as mainly all the things execute at the compile time.



    *Run Time Poltmorphism:    

        + The function to be invoked, í know at the run time.

        + Overriding is a run time polymorphism where more than one method is having the same name, number of parameters and the type of the parameters.

        + It is achieved by virtual functions and pointers.

        + It provides slow execution as it is known at the run time.

        + It is more flexible as all the things execute at the run time.
