    Syntax :
                int k = str1.compare(str2);  
        
        k == 0 : it means both the strings are equal. // bằng nhau
        k != 0 : it means both the strings are unequal. // không bằng nhau
        k > 0  : either the value of the first character is greater in the compared string or all the compared characters match but the compared string is longer.
        k < 0  : either the value of the first character is lower in the compared string or all the compared characters match but the compared string is shorter.
